Many website builders have outgrown their roots and morphed into overly complex, bloated CMS. 

**Feather** takes website building back to basics.

A core lightweight blogging engine with the addition of pages, should you need them.

**Feather** doesn't use a database, all content is stored in human readable text files which means your entire site can be under version control!

With support for themes, addons, posts, pages, tags & pagination, **Feather** is anything but basic.

**Feather** is all about **performance** too! <span class="ec ec-sunglasses"></span>

Setup is a **breeze**. 

Upload to your server, edit a single file and away you go!

Creating content is just as easy. 

Simply create your **Markdown** files for posts in the `posts/` directory, and your pages in the `pages/` directory, and Feather will do the rest! <span class="ec ec-heart-eyes"></span>
